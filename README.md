## Abstract

We introduce and empirically validate a new framework for the physics of emotion based on the **Smallest Unit of Intelligence (SUI)**. This model treats every emotion as a quantized event—an irreducible “click” of understanding that collapses symbolic uncertainty into clarity. Using EEG, VR, and pupillometry experiments, we show that insight and emotion can be measured as discrete entropy-resolution events. Our results establish objective thresholds for emotional insight, reveal the optimal “flow” zone for human cognition, and define a mathematical transition from anxiety to awe. The findings open the path to a rigorous informational physics of consciousness, with direct applications for neuroscience, adaptive AI, and the engineering of human experience.
